  Hey there! My name is Ralph Kühnert and I&rsquo;m a Cloud Architect, Software Developer and DevOps Engineer. I design and build elastic, scalable cloud infrastructure to serve highly-available applications on a global scale, using modern, cloud-native and predominantly open-source tech.
I&rsquo;m striving to design generic infrastructure and application platforms, maintained and operated through normalized interfaces. I believe that all componentry should be accessible and exposable via unified and homogenous APIs, enabling globally-distributed teams with different technical backgrounds to interconnect flawlessly through normalized abstraction."/>

<p>Hey there! My name is Ralph Kühnert and I&rsquo;m a Cloud Architect, Software Developer and DevOps Engineer. I design and build elastic, scalable cloud infrastructure to serve highly-available applications on a global scale, using modern, cloud-native and predominantly open-source tech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m striving to design generic infrastructure and application platforms, maintained and operated through normalized interfaces.

<p><strong>My:</strong> <a href="#technical-expertise"><strong>Technical Expertise</strong></a> | <a href="#career"><strong>Career</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="technical-expertise">Technical Expertise</h3>
<p>I believe right now a couple of technologies and paradigms converge to enable building platforms that at least approximate such a vision. <em><strong>Kubernetes</strong></em> uniquely ties them together, to offer a unified API and accompanying reconciliation logic to provide services that especially suit the infrastructure automation disciplines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes
<ul>
<li>Unified API interfaces for all Objects alive in the platform (API Server/OpenAPI)</li>
<li>Payload buffer and reconciliation logic to interact with asynchronously (API Server/Resources/etcd/Controllers)</li>
<li>Technical Independence from traditional VMs and Operating Systems (Containers)</li>
<li>Technical and Operational Independence from other services (Microservices)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GitOps
<ul>
<li>Traceable, reproducible, pull-based workflows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cloud-native tooling (<a href="https://l.cncf.io">CNCF Landscape</a>)
<ul>
<li>Observability (Prometheus, FluentD, Grafana, Kibana, Jaeger, &hellip;)</li>
<li>Data Storage (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, S3, &hellip;)</li>
<li>et al.</li>

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p><strong>Hilti AG, Liechtenstein</strong> <em>since May 2019</em></p>
<p>Cloud Architect / Engineering Lead</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Hilti the opportunity arose, to design and lead development of a new cloud-native and multi-purpose infrastructure platform to serve as a foundation for various projects around the globe. I took the opportunity, moving from the start-up sphere into the corporate world, with Hilti not only just being a technical innovator, but also a global front-runner in its various business areas.</p>

<p><strong>Loodse, Germany</strong> from <em>Nov 2018 - April 2019</em></p>
<p>Developer / Consultant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I moved to Loodse in order to focus more on kubernetes, and to gain more insight into the forefront of modern cloud-native infrastructure design and engineering. Loodse, with their own range of kubernetes-focused tech, is not only one an active player in the global kubernetes ecosystem, but also an innovation driver. Working here, I learned a lot about what it means to work on the frontier of modern design and how to learn and adapt quickly, but also how to facilitate implementation and design for environments traditionally not used to fast-paced iteration.</p>

<p><strong>Braintribe, Austria</strong> from <em>Sep 2013 - Oct 2018</em></p>
<p>Developer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Braintribe is a Vienna, Austria-based start-up, with a tech-heavy focus, developing a generic computing and data normalization platform, and various solutions on top of it. I spent some wonderfully rich and insightful years here, acquiring and honing skills and a well-rounded view on software architecture and abstraction design. Initially starting to work on test automation, my role quickly shifted towards engineering infrastructure automation solutions for the platform and implementing DevOps componentry for the development, test and deployment workflows. The move to the Cloud for the platform, as a scalable service to build solutions of any size and networking requirements, required me to build up a deep understanding of modern infrastructure architecture and operations and a strong skillset to develop such.
Working in a start-up really is the greatest learning experience, from business to tech skills. Nothing is more unforgiving than the deep end&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Tricentis, Austria</strong> from <em>Feb 2013 - Aug 2013</em></p>
<p>Technical Test Consultant</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working as a Technical Test Consultant with different clients in Switzerland and Austria, I had a chance to understand the fundamentals of Test Automation in high-risk business areas (banking) and an understanding of the infrastructural and operational dependencies for efficient test automation. Tricentis was a great employer, that grew a lot since then - awesome to see!</p>
